         <p>The collection catalogued in 1878 comprised MSS. Ch. Suffolk 1-1474 and MSS. Rolls Suffok 1-37. Turner and Coxe made no attempt to distinguish the sources of the collection, of which the most important were (1) material collected by Thomas Tanner, 1674–1735, and bequeathed by him to the Bodleian (2) material collected by Thomas Martin of Palgrave (1697–1771), subsequently acquired by Richard Gough (1735-1809) and bequeathed by him to the Bodleian. Further research is needed to distinguish the provenance of individual items.</p><p>
            Related material from Tanner’s collections relating to Wickham Skeith is in MSS. Ch. Essex.</p><p>
            MSS. Ch. Suffolk 1475-1583 and MS. Rolls Suffolk 38 are later accessions from various sources, of which the most substantial (Ch. 1475-1546) consists of items presented in 1889 by the executrix of Prof. H. W. Chandler (Summary Catalogue V.904).
