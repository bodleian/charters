         <p>MSS. Ch. Bucks. 1-94, Rolls Bucks. 1-2 represent the collection catalogued in 1878. The 1878 catalogue divides the collection between Ravenstone Priory (Ch. 1-37), Notley or Nutley Abbey (Ch. 38-43), Tickford Priory ('34-44' - 60), and charters of unstated provenance. The three priories were part of the endowment of Christ Church; the documents in the present collection were acquired by Anthony Wood and given by him to the Bodleian. Related documents, originally part of the same archives, are in D. D. Ch. Ch. M.</p>
