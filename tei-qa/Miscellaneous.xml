         <p>This collection represents charters and seals which could not be placed in the county series in the catalogue of 1878. The catalogue of 1878 (pp. 644-7) listed 210 charters in an appendix with separate numbering Ch. Appendix 1-210. These were later renumbered and placed in the county series so that, for example, Ch. Appendix became Ch. Wilts 35.</p>
         <p>The numbering of Ch. Misc. (211-536) continues the original Appendix sequence. Only Ch. Misc. 211-240 were catalogued in 1878: Ch. Misc. 241-536 were never catalogued and are being described for the first time in the present catalogue. Ch. Misc. 536*-682* are seals not currently associated with documents.</p>
