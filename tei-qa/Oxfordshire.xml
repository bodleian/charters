         <p>As with other series shelfmarked MS. Ch. and MS. Rolls, this is an artificial collection created from a range of archival sources, and the provenance of individual items is not always known.</p>
         <p>The collection catalogued in 1878 comprised MSS. Ch. Oxon. 1-230, MSS. Ch. Oxon. Oseney 1-566, MSS. Rolls Oxon. 1-62, and MSS. Rolls Oxon. Oseney 1-114. (MS. Rolls Oxon. Oseney 115 was added to the collection slightly later.) The principal sources were the archives of Osney Abbey, St Frideswide's Priory, Thame Abbey and Littlemore Priory. As described in the collection overview for D. D. Ch. Ch., these had formed part of the endowment of Cardinal College and later Christ Church Oxford. Part of the archive was acquired by Anthony Wood, bequeathed by him to the Ashmolean Museum and transferred to the Bodleian in 1860. The remainder of the archive (now D. D. Ch. Ch.) remained at Christ Church until 1927 when it was placed on deposit in the Bodleian.</p>
         <p>The principal later accessions include:
