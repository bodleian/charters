                        Letters patent of <persName>Hen. VIII</persName> inspecting
                        (i) <persName>
                           <forename>George</forename> Lord Burgavenny</persName>’s bill in
                        Chancery against <persName>
                           <forename>Thomas</forename> 
                           <surname>Cumberforth</surname>
                        </persName>. The plea is
                        that T. C. acquired the manor of <placeName type="manor" key="place_1083234">Wyggynton</placeName> for
                        £580, but on condition that
                        he should restore it to G. lord B. if the latter repaid the purchase money,
                        with a sum to be decided by the arbitration of 
                        <persName>Sir <forename>John</forename> 
                           <surname>Aston</surname>
                        </persName> and
                        <persName>Sir <forename>Edward</forename> 
                           <surname>Ferrers</surname>
                        </persName>,
                        kts., for improvements, within 6 years. On his refusal to do so G.
                        lord B. filed this complaint. 
                        
                        (ii) the <hi rend="italic">sub poena</hi> summoning T. C.
                        (<origDate when="1518-11-06">6 Nov. 10 Hen. VIII</origDate>). 
                        
                        (iii) The answer of T. C., who denied that the sale
                        had been conditional. They had made the bargain about the 8th of May 5 Hen.
                        VIII, and the indentures had been drawn up on the 10th., but lord B. would
                        not seal them until he had received £100 in part payment from T. C., and
                        when this had been done he still refused to seal, demanding the £100 as a
                        loan until his return from France. <pb n="209"/> T. C. replied that this was
                        impossible, as he had pledged his lands to the clear yearly value of
                        £32/13/4 in order to raise the £580, but lord B. would not return the £100.
                        Lord B. then went to France. 
                        
                        Afterwards one Doctor Roote, ‘being of
                        Counseille with the seid lord, movyd unto the seid’ T. C., that if lord B.
                        repaid the £580 he should have back his manor. Thomas disagreed, but not
                        knowing how he should come to the perfection of his bargain nor to the
                        repayment of his money, sealed the bill which lord B. had drawn up
                        containing the above mentioned condition.
                        
                        The deposition of

                        clause there on 6 June 5 Hen. VIII, and T. C. sealed it without any
                        compulsion. ‘Which bill was then made in great haste because the king was in
                        preparyng him toward Canterbury and had ywyn knowledge to lye at the seid

                        that the condition was sealed before the indentures.
