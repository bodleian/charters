                        2. what the lawe is.
                        The pointe where you desire to be resolved is,
                        whether this Lease of the 14th of Aprille an° 29°. H. 8. bee a good lease
                        against the Deane and Chapter or not. To which I answere shortly, that it is
                        a voyed Lease in all: or not good for any more then Seaven yeares to come in
                        Apriell next. Whether it bee voied in all or no, I stand doubtfulle, but
                        that it can not bee good for any more then Seaven yeeres in Aprille next, I
                        ame resolute. 
                         For the pointe which hath carried awaye your
                        conceipt, I take yt it will not helpe you, or I finde that at the makinge of
                        the lease in 29° he was an Abbot by election and not by commendacion: as ys
                        conceaved: and whether he weare then Episco: Reoven’ 
                        (Whether it be materiall in common law, to make him onelie a
                            commandatorie Abbot, though he were elect, because he was at that tyme
                            also Episc. Revens’.) or not, I thinck in our Law it will not be
                        greately materialle. But the pointe whereupon I finde helpe for you is this.
                        The first Lease made by R. K. in Marche an° 27°. H. 8. for 31 yeeres in
                        revercion: was a meere voyed Lease bycause hee was then but a Commendatory
                        and had no power to make such a Lease. And when hee after in 29°. H. 8.
                        beinge a perfitt Abbot doeth confirme this Lease, that confirmacion is
                        likewise voied for that a voyed Lease can never bee made good by
                        confirmation. And when hee goeth on and saieth that he doeth geive demise
                        and graunt, these bee good Woords to have made a new demise, yf he had
                        expressed, what he did geive, demise, and graunte. And when he saieth
                        Habendum for the terme of the said <gap/> Yeeres (with a space) after the
                        forme and effect in the saied former Indenture specified and declared: I
                        thinke that the terme should have beene expressed in certaine, and that the
                        reference to the former Indenture is cleerely nought. Then the Lease for 31
                        yeeres beinge voyed, this is your Case. 
                        <pb n="191"/> 
                        A Lease is made for 68
                        yeeres to beginne uppon the expiracion of a voied lease: when this shall
                        beginne that is your pointe. The grounde of Lawe is, that yf a lease for
                        <gap/> yeeres have not a certaine tyme when it shall beginne and when it
                        shall ende, then it is voyed. The meaning was that this Lease should
                        beginne, when the voyed Lease by effluxion of tyme shoulde have ended, but
                        by Law this can not bee, for that a voyed Lease hath no tyme to beginne nor
                        no tyme to ende. Then the second Lease must either bee voied, or else the
                        Lawe must appoint a tyme when it shall beginne. Also the Lawe then, when it
                        shall beginne, and the answere is plaine: yf it shall beginne at all, it
                        must beginne from the makinge. And then from the 14 of Apriell an° 29° H. 8.
                        which was in the yeare 1537 to the 14th of Apriell an° 39 Eliz. in the yeere
                        1597, are iuste three-score yeeres and so of this Lease in Apriell next are
                        seaven yeeres to come. 
                        
                        3. What maner of proceeding is fittest to be used against the tenent.
                        Now for your proceedinge against the Tennaunt, yf you
                        shall resolve to attempt suite, then I have formerly directed a course yf
                        you thinke good to deale with the tennaunt by waye of mediatis, then you can
                        better advise yourselfe, then I can direct: if you would have mee to confer
                        with any other, I can like verie well of it. The coppie of the lease which I
                        receaved of you togeather with the other writings which I received of my
                        cosin <persName><surname>Thornton</surname></persName> I have sent you by this bearer. I have likewise sent you the
                        court Rolle of <placeName key="place_108012">Daventree</placeName>: which I wishe should bee kept amongst your
                        evidences of Daventree, that you maye have recourse to your Rolles as you
                        shall have occasion. 
                         
                        4. Whither our leete at Daventrie be loste by non use, or no. 
                        For the court Leete at Daventree I would bee glad
                        to keepe it when I maye bee assisted by your selfe or by somme of the
                        Chapter. You see how much wee have beene resisted when we have doen no more
                        than we have good authoritie in Lawe to doe: what shall I looke for them, yf
                        I goe alone to doe that which I knowe I can not instefie; I doubt that in
                        extremitie of Lawe, you have lost your Leete by not usinge it, and therefore
                        I would wishe that Mr. Attorney weare first made acquainted with it, and
                        that at Easter you should keepe bothe a leete and a courte Baron. And thus
                        havinge troubled you over longe, I hartely wishe you all comfortable
                        happinesse in Christ Jesus.

                        (i) Napper’s <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi> stated that <persName><surname>Royse</surname></persName>’s
                        lease did not begin until the expiring of a former lease (dated 15 March 27
                        Hen. VIII) to the same H. R. for 31 years. 
                        
                        This lease he bought from H. R.
                        He claimed to have cut no timber unlawfully, and to have erected buildings
                        at his own cost. <hi rend="italic">The Replication</hi>
                        (MM. 28 (ii)) stated that the lease of 15 March 27 Hen. VIII was void, because
                        <persName><forename>Robert</forename> <surname>King</surname></persName> was not yet
                        abbot, and that this made void also the second lease. 
                        <hi rend="italic">The Rejoinder</hi> (MM. 28 (iii)) denied this.

                        (MM. 28 (v)) seem to show
                        that Ch. Ch. was really seeking for a decree to enable them to raise the
                        rent. (<persName><forename>John</forename> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, burser of Ch. Ch., pointed out, and the other witnesses agreed that Church Cowley was worth £12 per
                        annum.) Emphasis is laid on the evils of the long leases and low
                        rents which had been bequeathed to them by the monasteries. e.g.
                        <persName><forename>Thomas</forename> <surname>Smyth</surname></persName> said that
                        ‘in the tyme when Doctor Ravis was first Deane of the saide
                        Colledge, the house was in such want that they were not able to pay for
                        there bred and other Commons, neither yet had they beene able to maynteyne
                        the house and Commons thereof, yf divers men had not beene with them for the
                        payment of great summes of money which they then owed for such necessaries
                        as weare for the mayntenaunce of there ordinary Commons’. (MM. 28 (iv) ff. 8 and 9.)
                        <persName><forename>Richard</forename> <surname>Rice</surname></persName> said that
                        he ‘hath knowne the said Colledge in such extremities
                        that the Deane and Chapter thereof have heretofore thought uppon a

                        <persName>Charles II</persName>, wishing to enclose part of the forest had compensated the

                        had common rights in the forest. In <date when="1661">1661</date> the then lord Treasurer authorized

                        were by His Majesties souldiers turned in upon it, and lay all over it
                        during the late wars, the better to keep the enemy from the Garrison; by

                        and in planting many trees thereupon, and in other good husbandry, which
                        cost the said <hi rend="italic">Will. Adkins</hi>
                        at least £800 in so much that he did thereby improve the said Medow to be
                        worth yearly as much more as it was worth when the said 
                        <hi rend="italic">Will. Adkins</hi> did first enter upon it. 
                        
                        That after this the said <hi rend="italic">Will Adkins</hi> did renew the
                        Lease from the Dean and Chapter again, who by their Indenture under their
                        Common Seal, bearing date the 10 day of March <date when="1654">1654</date>. did demise <pb n="199"/>
                        unto the said <hi rend="italic">Will. Adkins</hi>
                        for 21 years thence next ensuing, at and under the said former improved rent
                        in Money and Com, for which said new Lease <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> did pay unto 
                        them the summe of £300. for a Fine whereby it appears that the said Adkins did
                        disburse in Fines and the said other Charges for improving the said
                        Premisses, the sume of £1600 at the least. 
                        
                        That the said Medow after all his said Charges upon it, not being worth above £100
                        <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> the Profits
                        thereof hitherto have not near satisfied unto him the yearly Interest of his

                        same. 
                        
                        And yet notwithstanding, after the Restitution of his Majesty, 
                        <persName>Dr. <hi rend="italic"><surname>Fell</surname></hi></persName> being made
                        Dean of Christ Church, he and the present Chapter being desirous to have the said
                        Medow to their own uses again, and pretending that the said <hi rend="italic">Adkin’s</hi> Lease was void in
                        Law, in regard that the said Medow had not formerly been demised, did
                        without allowing any satisfaction to the said <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> about two 
                        years since Commence an action of Ejectment in the name of one

                        said Cause coming to tryal at the same Assizes for the County of <hi rend="italic">Oxford,</hi> 
                        in the year <date when="1661">1661</date> the said Defendant <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>
                        did then make proof of all the matters of fact, and the Jury were then ready
                        to have given a Verdict for <hi rend="italic">Adkins,</hi> but 
                        Dr. <hi rend="italic">Fell</hi> the Dean, and 
                        <persName>Dr. <hi rend="italic"><surname>Dolben</surname></hi> the Treasurer</persName> of the said Colledge, being both present in
                        the Court, perceiving the same, did move the Judge that the matters in
                        difference betwixt the said parties should be referred to the determination
                        and award of an Arbitrator of their own choosing, and thereupon it was
                        ordered at the said Assizes, that a Verdict by consent should be found for
                        the Plaintiffs, and that all the differences betwixt the parties should be
                        referred to the said Arbitrator, and that the <hi rend="italic">Postea</hi>
                        should remain in the hands of the Clerk of the Assizes, untill 
                        <persName>Mr. Justice <hi rend="italic"><surname>Windham</surname></hi></persName>
                        should give order to the contrary, as by that order may appear. 
                        
                        Upon which reference the said
                        arbitrator did take much pains to settle the differences betwixt them, but
                        could not; and did therefore at last (to prevent the ruin of the said
                        <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> and his family) on
                        his own award in writing, bearing date on the 28. day of October, <date when="1661">1661</date>.
                        betwixt the said parties, award that the said Dean and Chapter should pay to
                        the said <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>, towards the
                        satisfaction of all his Monies and Costs, the summe of £600 at our Lady-day
                        then next following; and that in case the said Monies should be then paid,
                        that then the said <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>
                        should surrender up his possession <pb n="200"/> and Lease to them; but in
                        case that the Monies should not be then paid, that then the said <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> or his Assignes
                        should hold and enjoy the said Medow for the term of 7 years only then next
                        ensuing, and that at the end of the term of 7 years deliver up his Lease and
                        possession to the said Dean and Chapter, as by the Award may appear. 
                        
                        And although the said Arbitrator did not award unto <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> one 
                        half of the Monies due to him, or that in case the said Monies should not be paid to
                        him, did award to him but one half of the term, he having 14. years to come
                        in his term at the time of the said Award; yet the said Dean and Chapter did
                        refuse to stand to the Award made by the said Arbitrator of their own
                        choosing; and yet notwithstanding all the said premisses, the said Dean and
                        Chapter did in the last Mich, term commence a new action of Ejectment in the
                        name of the said <hi rend="italic"><persName><forename>Thomas</forename> <surname>Hudson</surname></persName></hi> 
                        their former Lessee, against the said <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> for the recovering
                        the possession of the said Medow from him, and the Cause did come to tryal
                        this last Assizes at <hi rend="italic">Oxford,</hi>
                        and a Jury did appear, which were returned by the Prothonotary the last term
                        by order of the <orgName key="org_108015">Court of Common-pleas</orgName>. 
                        
                        And the Defendant <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> having made full
                        proof of all the Monies disbursed by him for the benefit of the Inheritance
                        of the said Colledge, and all the said before mentioned matters of fact, the
                        Jury after a long and full evidence given on both sides, did find their
                        Verdict for the Defendant <hi rend="italic">Adkins.</hi> 
                        
                        And yet notwithstanding it is endeavoured that a Proviso be
                        added unto the Act for confirming of Colledge Leases, that the said Act
                        shall not extend to confirm any Leases made of any Lands which were not let
                        or dimised for eleven years or more before the year of our Lord 1640, which
                        Proviso, if it should passe, would destroy the said Lease of <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>, 
                        and many more Leases, which this Dean <hi rend="italic">Fell,</hi> and the present
                        Chapter of Christs Church have confirmed of Lands never let before in Lease, 
                        till Bishop <hi rend="italic">Reynolds</hi> let them at that
                        time when <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> took his
                        Lease of him. 
                        
                        And likewise at <orgName key="org_108011">All-souls Colledge</orgName> in <hi rend="italic">Oxon</hi>
                        they have renewed
                        severall Leases of Lands that were never put in Lease, till much about the
                        time that <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> took his Lease of 
                        Bishop <hi rend="italic">Reynolds</hi>, and at <orgName key="org_109038">New Colledge</orgName> in
                        Oxford they have renewed with many Tenants with in
                        this year and a half, and confirmed their Leases of Lands that were never
                        put in Lease before about twelve years ago by those that were then
                        Governours in that place. 
                        
                        And yet <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi> doubts not but to
                        prove and make it appear that the said Medow hath been in ancient times
                        demised at an old <pb n="201"/> Rent, and the said Lease is good by the Laws
                        of this Land, if it be not avoided by the said Provise. 
                        
                        And it is manifestly known that Dr. <hi rend="italic">Fell</hi> who lays
                        claim to half this Medow for himself, as he is now Dean of Christs Church,
                        was never formerly invested in any part of it, nor those five Canons
                        likewise who seek to take the other from <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>, and the 
                        improved Rent from the Students, which likewise were not formerly invested in these
                        Lands. And the other two old Canons are those that were there when 
                        Bishop <hi rend="italic">Reynolds</hi> let the Lease to 
                        <hi rend="italic">Adkins</hi>, and took their Fines, and remain established
                        Canons there still. 
                        
                        <hi rend="italic">The premisses considered, it is
                            humbly submitted to judgment what these Leases can he worth to those
                            Tenants who have paid great Fines, and have renewed their Leases within
                            these two years, with these Governours, if they he called away, and
                            other Governours put in their places.</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">And therefore the said</hi>
                        Adkins <hi rend="italic">humbly prays and hopes
                            that the said Proviso shall not passe, but that his Lease may be
                            confirmed as well as other Colledge Leases, and that the Law may
                            determine the Title of the same betwixt him and the said Dean and
                            Chapter.</hi>

                        that T. C. acquired the manor of <placeName type="manor" key="place_1083234">Wyggynton</placeName> for
                        £580, but on condition that
                        he should restore it to G. lord B. if the latter repaid the purchase money,
                        with a sum to be decided by the arbitration of 
                        <persName>Sir <forename>John</forename> <surname>Aston</surname></persName> and

                        lord B. filed this complaint.

                        (iii) The answer of T. C., who denied that the sale
                        had been conditional. They had made the bargain about the 8th of May 5 Hen.
                        VIII, and the indentures had been drawn up on the 10th., but lord B. would
                        not seal them until he had received £100 in part payment from T. C., and
                        when this had been done he still refused to seal, demanding the £100 as a
                        loan until his return from France. <pb n="209"/> T. C. replied that this was
                        impossible, as he had pledged his lands to the clear yearly value of
                        £32/13/4 in order to raise the £580, but lord B. would not return the £100.
                        Lord B. then went to France. 
                        
                        Afterwards one Doctor Roote, ‘being of

                        repaid the £580 he should have back his manor. Thomas disagreed, but not
                        knowing how he should come to the perfection of his bargain nor to the
                        repayment of his money, sealed the bill which lord B. had drawn up
                        containing the above mentioned condition.

                        clause there on 6 June 5 Hen. VIII, and T. C. sealed it without any
                        compulsion. ‘Which bill was then made in great haste because the king was in
